# Agile Challenge Cards Activity - Web Application

## Project Overview

This web application aims to replace the physical deck of cards used in the Agile Challenge Cards Activity. Participants can use the application to draw challenge cards, form groups, and work on sustainability challenges within specified focus areas using Agile practices.

## Objective

The Agile Challenge Cards Activity aims to utilize Agile practices to rapidly develop solutions to sustainability challenges within specific focus areas. Participants will form groups, brainstorm, prioritize, and develop solutions through iterative sprints.

## Materials Needed

1. **Web Application**: This application will serve as the digital deck of cards, providing challenge cards and tracking group progress.
2. **Timer**: Integrated within the web app.
3. **Whiteboards and markers/Tracking Sheet**: Optional, if participants prefer physical tracking.
4. **Sticky notes and pens**: Optional, for those who prefer physical brainstorming.

## Procedure

### 1. Initial Briefing (5 minutes)
- **Objective**: Explain the Agile principles: flexibility, adaptive planning, continuous improvement, and rapid response to change.
- **Approach**: Discuss how these principles can be applied to solving sustainability challenges.

### 2. Team Formation and Card Drawing (5 minutes)
- **Objective**: Form small groups and draw Challenge Cards.
- **Approach**: Each group uses the web application to draw 5 Challenge Cards but keeps only 1. The card contains a specific sustainability issue.

### 3. First Agile Sprint - Ideation (10 minutes)
- **Task**: Brainstorm potential solutions to the challenge.
- **Approach**: Use the web application's brainstorming feature or physical sticky notes to generate ideas rapidly without judgment.
- **Output**: A collection of diverse ideas.

### 4. Review and Planning (5 minutes)
- **Task**: Categorize and prioritize the ideas based on feasibility and impact.
- **Approach**: Use the web application to group similar ideas and select the top ones to develop further.
- **Output**: A prioritized list of ideas.

### 5. Second Agile Sprint - Solution Development (15 minutes)
- **Task**: Develop a detailed plan or prototype for the top ideas.
- **Approach**: Encourage iterative refinement. Teams can split tasks among members focusing on research, design, or impact analysis.
- **Output**: A basic prototype or detailed solution plan.

### 6. Team Presentation and Feedback (10 minutes)
- **Task**: Present the solution to the class.
- **Approach**: Use the web application to present and gather feedback based on criteria such as innovation, impact, and practicality.
- **Output**: Refined project proposals.

### 7. Retrospective and Iterative Improvement (5 minutes)
- **Task**: Reflect on what went well and what could be improved.
- **Approach**: Discuss as a whole class or within small groups to identify lessons learned and possible improvements for future sprints.
- **Output**: Insights that can guide future projects and iterations.
